# Books SDK

Goodreads (Amazon :( ) deprecated their api. I needed a way to abstract consuming my list data so that I could continue making better sorting possible.

I want a sort that factors in year published, number of reviews, and reading level, along with overall rating to help me make decisions on which book to read next.
